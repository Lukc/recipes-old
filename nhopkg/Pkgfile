description="Lightweight and powerfull package manager system."
longdesc="Nhopkg is a lightweight and powerfull package manager system for
UNIX-like operating systems. Nhopkg can install, remove, update,
search and manage software packages (.nho). Nhopkg is currently
written in Bash Shell Script, but it will be written in Python in
the next version.

Nhopkg aims to be a universal package manager. For this, Nhopkg 
isn't only a package manager, furthermore it is a set of guidelines
to pack up software for any machine. Therefore, to check package
dependencies, Nhopkg searches for specific files instead of package
names."
